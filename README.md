## AI-Assisted-Programming
#This repository is dedicated to code generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence. 
It is important to note that any code in this repository will not be entirely original, as it is generated by AI and then tweaked by the user. When contributing to this repository, please provide detailed documentation to help other users understand your code. If you make changes to someone else's code, please create a new file with a different name, indicating that it is a copy, to avoid losing the original code, which may be useful in other programs. It is important to maintain a respectful and professional tone in this space, as it is intended for learning. While we all enjoy humor, please ensure that any jokes shared are appropriate for a work environment.
